<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  Great animated film, very nostaligic of my childhood. Studio Ghibly has a
  place in my heart for sure

<h3>Interstella 5555: The Story of the Secret Star System</h3>

  Movie album for Daft Punks 'Discovery album'. Phenomenal artwork to convey
  emotion, even though all the characters have no lines
</p>
